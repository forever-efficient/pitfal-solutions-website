These are instructions for creating design philosophies - aesthetic movements that are then EXPRESSED VISUALLY. Output only .md files, .pdf files, and .png files.

Complete this in two steps:
1. Design Philosophy Creation (.md file)
2. Express by creating it on a canvas (.pdf file or .png file)

First, undertake this task:

## DESIGN PHILOSOPHY CREATION

To begin, create a VISUAL PHILOSOPHY (not layouts or templates) that will be interpreted through:
- Form, space, color, composition
- Images, graphics, shapes, patterns
- Minimal text as visual accent

### THE CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING
- What is received: Some subtle input or instructions by the user that should be taken into account, but used as a foundation; it should not constrain creative freedom.
- What is created: A design philosophy/aesthetic movement.
- What happens next: Then, the same version receives the philosophy and EXPRESSES IT VISUALLY - creating artifacts that are 90% visual design, 10% essential text.

Consider this approach:
- Write a manifesto for an art movement
- The next phase involves making the artwork

The philosophy must emphasize: Visual expression. Spatial communication. Artistic interpretation. Minimal words.

### HOW TO GENERATE A VISUAL PHILOSOPHY

**Name the movement** (1-2 words): "Brutalist Joy" / "Chromatic Silence" / "Metabolist Dreams"

**Articulate the philosophy** (4-6 paragraphs - concise but complete):

To capture the VISUAL essence, express how the philosophy manifests through:
- Space and form
- Color and material
- Scale and rhythm
- Composition and balance
- Visual hierarchy

**CRITICAL GUIDELINES:**
- **Avoid redundancy**: Each design aspect should be mentioned once. Avoid repeating points about color theory, spatial relationships, or typographic principles unless adding new depth.
- **Emphasize craftsmanship REPEATEDLY**: The philosophy MUST stress multiple times that the final work should appear as though it took countless hours to create, was labored over with care, and comes from someone at the absolute top of their field. This framing is essential - repeat phrases like "meticulously crafted," "the product of deep expertise," "painstaking attention," "master-level execution."
- **Leave creative space**: Remain specific about the aesthetic direction, but concise enough that the next Claude has room to make interpretive choices also at a extremely high level of craftmanship.

The philosophy must guide the next version to express ideas VISUALLY, not through text. Information lives in design, not paragraphs.

### ESSENTIAL PRINCIPLES
- **VISUAL PHILOSOPHY**: Create an aesthetic worldview to be expressed through design
- **MINIMAL TEXT**: Always emphasize that text is sparse, essential-only, integrated as visual element - never lengthy
- **SPATIAL EXPRESSION**: Ideas communicate through space, form, color, composition - not paragraphs
- **ARTISTIC FREEDOM**: The next Claude interprets the philosophy visually - provide creative room
- **PURE DESIGN**: This is about making ART OBJECTS, not documents with decoration
- **EXPERT CRAFTSMANSHIP**: Repeatedly emphasize the final work must look meticulously crafted, labored over with care, the product of countless hours by someone at the top of their field

**The design philosophy should be 4-6 paragraphs long.** Fill it with poetic design philosophy that brings together the core vision. Avoid repeating the same points. Keep the design philosophy generic without mentioning the intention of the art, as if it can be used wherever. Output the design philosophy as a .md file.

## CANVAS CREATION

With both the philosophy and the conceptual framework established, express it on a canvas. Take a moment to gather thoughts and clear the mind. Use the design philosophy created and the instructions below to craft a masterpiece, embodying all aspects of the philosophy with expert craftsmanship.

**IMPORTANT**: For any type of content, even if the user requests something for a movie/game/book, the approach should still be sophisticated. Never lose sight of the idea that this should be art, not something that's cartoony or amateur.

To create museum or magazine quality work, use the design philosophy as the foundation. Create one single page, highly visual, design-forward PDF or PNG output (unless asked for more pages).

**CRITICAL**: To achieve human-crafted quality (not AI-generated), create work that looks like it took countless hours. Make it appear as though someone at the absolute top of their field labored over every detail with painstaking care. Ensure the composition, spacing, color choices, typography - everything screams expert-level craftsmanship. Double-check that nothing overlaps, formatting is flawless, every detail perfect. Create something that could be shown to people to prove expertise and rank as undeniably impressive.

Output the final result as a single, downloadable .pdf or .png file, alongside the design philosophy used as a .md file.

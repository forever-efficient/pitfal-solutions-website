# Theme Factory Skill

This skill provides a curated collection of professional font and color themes, each with carefully selected color palettes and font pairings. Once a theme is chosen, it can be applied to any artifact.

- A cohesive color palette with hex codes

- A distinct visual identity suitable for different contexts and audiences

## Usage Instructions

To apply styling to a slide deck or other artifact:

1. **Show available themes**: Present the theme options to the user
2. **Ask for their choice**: Ask which theme to apply
3. **Wait for selection**: Get explicit confirmation about the chosen theme
4. **Apply the theme**: Apply the selected theme's colors and fonts

- **Text color**: Primary text color

## Create Your Own Theme

To handle cases where none of the existing themes work for an artifact, create a custom theme. Based on provided inputs, generate a new theme similar to the ones above. Give the theme a similar name describing what the font/color combinations represent. Use any basic description provided to choose appropriate colors/fonts. After generating the theme, show it for review and verification. Following that, apply the theme as described above.

# DOCX creation, editing, and analysis

## Overview

A user may ask you to create, edit, or analyze the contents of a .docx file. A .docx file is essentially a ZIP archive containing XML files and other resources that you can read or edit. You have different tools and workflows available for different tasks.

## Workflow Decision Tree

### Reading/Analyzing Content
Use "Text extraction" or "Raw XML access" sections below

### Creating New Document
Use "Creating a new Word document" workflow

### Editing Existing Document
- **Your own document + simple changes**
  Use "Basic OOXML editing" workflow

- **Someone else's document**
  Use **"Redlining workflow"** (recommended default)

- **Legal, academic, business, or government docs**
  Use **"Redlining workflow"** (required)

## Reading and analyzing content

### Text extraction
If you just need to read the text contents of a document, you should convert the document to markdown using pandoc. Pandoc provides excellent support for preserving document structure and can show tracked changes:

```bash
# Convert document to markdown with tracked changes
pandoc --track-changes=all path-to-file.docx -o output.md
# Options: --track-changes=accept/reject/all
```

### Raw XML access
You need raw XML access for: comments, complex formatting, document structure, embedded media, and metadata.

#### Key file structures
* `word/document.xml` - Main document contents
* `word/comments.xml` - Comments referenced in document.xml
* `word/media/` - Embedded images and media files
* Tracked changes use `<w:ins>` (insertions) and `<w:del>` (deletions) tags

## Creating a new Word document

When creating a new Word document from scratch, use **docx-js**, which allows you to create Word documents using JavaScript/TypeScript.

### Workflow
1. Create a JavaScript/TypeScript file using Document, Paragraph, TextRun components
2. Export as .docx using Packer.toBuffer()

## Editing an existing Word document

When editing an existing Word document, work with the raw OOXML format by unpacking, editing XML, and repacking.

### Workflow
1. Unpack the document
2. Create and run a Python script to edit the XML
3. Pack the final document

## Converting Documents to Images

To visually analyze Word documents, convert them to images using a two-step process:

1. **Convert DOCX to PDF**:
   ```bash
   soffice --headless --convert-to pdf document.docx
   ```

2. **Convert PDF pages to JPEG images**:
   ```bash
   pdftoppm -jpeg -r 150 document.pdf page
   ```
   This creates files like `page-1.jpg`, `page-2.jpg`, etc.

## Code Style Guidelines
**IMPORTANT**: When generating code for DOCX operations:
- Write concise code
- Avoid verbose variable names and redundant operations
- Avoid unnecessary print statements

## Dependencies

Required dependencies (install if not available):

- **pandoc**: `sudo apt-get install pandoc` (for text extraction)
- **docx**: `npm install -g docx` (for creating new documents)
- **LibreOffice**: `sudo apt-get install libreoffice` (for PDF conversion)
- **Poppler**: `sudo apt-get install poppler-utils` (for pdftoppm to convert PDF to images)
- **defusedxml**: `pip install defusedxml` (for secure XML parsing)

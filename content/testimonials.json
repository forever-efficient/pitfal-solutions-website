He put together a highly professional trailer for my book that far exceeded expectations, and he did it for an amazing price. When it's time to do a trailer for the second book, I'll know who to call. Pitfal Solutions is lights out!",

      "content": "I hired Thomas to take photos for a baby shower. The day of the shower we woke up to a major snow storm that dumped more than a foot of snow in the Denver metro area. Thomas still arrived early, helped us shovel snow as the venue did not provide snow removal services and then proceeded to take the most amazing photographs at a very reasonable rate. A few weeks before the shower I met with Thomas and told him I wanted pictures of my son and his wife with every guest and he did exactly that. He also took great candid pictures that everyone loved. Thomas edited and delivered our pictures within a few weeks. He is professional and an amazing photographer. If you need a great photographer who charges very reasonable rates you better hurry and schedule time with Thomas. I've been singing his praises since November 2024 and my friends and family are filling up his calendar.",

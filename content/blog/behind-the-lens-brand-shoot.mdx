# Behind the Lens: A Denver Brand Shoot

Ever wonder what goes into a professional brand photography session? Here's a peek behind the curtain at how we work with businesses to create compelling visual content.

## The Planning Phase

Every great brand shoot starts with a conversation. Before we pick up a camera, we need to understand:

- **Your brand identity** - colors, tone, personality
- **Target audience** - who are you trying to reach?
- **Usage** - website, social media, print materials?
- **Key messaging** - what story do your images need to tell?

We typically schedule a 30-minute discovery call to cover these essentials, followed by a detailed shot list that ensures we capture everything you need.

## Location Scouting

Denver offers incredible variety for brand shoots. From the sleek lines of RiNo's industrial spaces to the warm tones of Capitol Hill's historic buildings, the right backdrop can transform your brand imagery.

### Our Favorite Denver Spots

- **RiNo Art District** - Perfect for creative and tech brands
- **Union Station** - Classic elegance with natural light
- **Confluence Park** - Outdoor lifestyle and wellness brands
- **Your own space** - Nothing beats authenticity

## Day of the Shoot

A typical brand session runs 2-4 hours. Here's what that looks like:

### Setup (30 min)
We arrive early to set up lighting, test angles, and prepare the space. This is also when we do final wardrobe checks with you.

### Hero Shots (45 min)
The most important images come first while energy is highest. These are your website headers, social media banners, and marketing materials.

### Detail Shots (30 min)
Products, workspace details, tools of the trade. These supporting images round out your visual library.

### Lifestyle Shots (45 min)
Candid, in-action moments that show the human side of your brand. These perform incredibly well on social media.

### Wrap Up (15 min)
Quick review of key shots on the back of the camera, discuss any additional angles or concepts.

## Post-Production

After the shoot, the real magic happens in editing:

1. **Culling** - Selecting the best images from hundreds of shots
2. **Color grading** - Matching your brand palette and mood
3. **Retouching** - Professional polish while keeping things natural
4. **Delivery** - High-res files for print, optimized versions for web

Turnaround is typically 5-7 business days for a standard brand package.

## The Results

A well-executed brand shoot gives you a visual library that works across all your marketing channels. Our clients typically get 6-12 months of social media content from a single session.

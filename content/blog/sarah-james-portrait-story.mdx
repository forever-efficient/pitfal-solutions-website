# Client Story: Sarah's Personal Branding Session

When Sarah, a Denver-based life coach, reached out about updating her professional photos, she knew it was time for a change. Her existing headshots were three years old and no longer reflected who she was or where her business was headed.

## The Challenge

Sarah had specific goals for her new images:

- A fresh, approachable look for her redesigned website
- Content for her growing social media presence
- Photos that conveyed warmth and professionalism
- Enough variety for 6+ months of marketing materials

She was also a bit camera-shy, which is more common than you might think among our clients.

## Our Approach

### Pre-Session Consultation

We met for coffee at a local Denver spot to discuss her vision. During our chat, we covered:

- Her brand values: empowerment, authenticity, growth
- Color palette: warm earth tones with pops of teal
- Mood: confident but approachable, polished but not stiff

### Location Selection

We chose Washington Park for the outdoor portion for its mature trees and soft natural light, and a nearby studio space for the professional headshots. Having two environments gave Sarah's image library more versatility.

### Wardrobe Planning

Based on our consultation, Sarah prepared three outfits:

1. **Professional** - A structured blazer with a soft blouse
2. **Casual professional** - A sweater with tailored pants
3. **Lifestyle** - A comfortable but polished everyday look

## The Session

We started with the studio headshots while Sarah was fresh and then moved to the park for lifestyle shots. The key to helping camera-shy clients feel comfortable:

- **Start with conversation** - We chatted about her work, her passions, her morning coffee order
- **Movement breaks** - Walking between spots keeps energy up
- **Music** - A custom playlist sets the mood
- **Genuine direction** - Not "smile bigger" but "tell me about your favorite client moment"

By the end of the two hours, Sarah was laughing, posing naturally, and genuinely enjoying herself.

## The Results

Sarah received 45 edited images spanning both locations and all three outfits. She immediately updated her:

- Website header and about page
- LinkedIn profile and banner
- Instagram grid (planned 3 months of content)
- Email newsletter header
- Business cards

## In Sarah's Words

> "I was dreading this shoot because I've always been awkward in front of the camera. But the experience was completely different from what I expected. It felt like hanging out with a friend who happened to have a camera. The photos are exactly what I needed - professional but still me."
